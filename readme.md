4. Explain how the ABCD's are used in assessing a patient.
5. Describe the difference between a sign and a symptom.
6. Demonstrate how to assess the pupils.
7. Demonstrate how to assess eye movement.
8. List the normal vital signs for an infant, child, and adult.
9. Demonstrate where you can take five pulses in five different locations on the body.
10. Describe and demonstrate how to assess vital signs.

7.1 Explain and demonstrate the five parts of a patient assessment.

1. Scene Size-up: Ensure the scene is safe and identify the mechanism of injury or nature of illness.
2. Primary Patient Assessment: Assess and stabilize life-threatening conditions by checking airway, breathing, and circulation.
3. History Taking: Gather the patient's medical history, including present illness, past conditions, medications, and allergies.
4. Secondary Patient Assessment: Conduct a detailed head-to-toe physical examination to identify other injuries or conditions.
5. Reassessment: Continuously monitor the patient's vital signs and response to interventions to detect changes in their condition.


7.4. Explain how the ABCD's are used in assessing a patient.

The ABCD framework is commonly used in healthcare to assess various conditions, particularly when evaluating
aspects like pain, injury, and overall patient stability. The ABCD approach ensures that critical, life-threatening 
issues are identified and addressed promptly in an emergency or clinical situation.

Here's a brief explanation:

A - Airway:

Check if the patient's airway is clear and unobstructed.
Ensure the patient can breathe and speak normally without difficulty.
Any blockages (like swelling or foreign objects) need immediate attention.

B - Breathing:

Assess the patient's ability to breathe effectively.
Look for signs of respiratory distress (e.g., labored breathing, irregular breaths).
Check oxygen levels and respiratory rate.

C - Circulation:

Evaluate the patient's blood circulation, including heart rate, blood pressure, and skin color.
Look for signs of poor circulation such as cold, clammy skin, or weak pulse.
Assess for any bleeding or shock symptoms.


D - Disability:

Quickly assess the patient's neurological status.
Use tools like the AVPU scale (Alert, Verbal, Pain, Unresponsive) to determine consciousness level.
Check for any significant injuries or other conditions affecting motor function.
